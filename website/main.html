<h1>Hi all !</h1>

    <p>Welcome to Catopia, my self-ruled Kingdom where I reign with an iron paw on the slave I welcomed 4 months ago.</p>

    <p>  I heard you may be interested in a rental for some months, so let me first do a presentation of him:

      Aged of 33, he’s a full grown man able to work intensively on every human-requesting tasks, like pet me, feed me or throw the ball when I ask it.
      He did some studies in Economics, European Studies, Financial Risk Management and Business Analyse & IT Governance (but still seems to not understand the difference between a Miaow and a Miaoooow… Stupid human).

<div class="prez2">
  <p>    Before dedicating his whole life, time and attention to his loving King, he firstly pursue the dream of working in the banking sector. As life is full of surprises, he began his professional life working in the insurance sector for an American company as a first and second line administrative case manager (and that for about 3 years).
      Administrating insurance policies and taking care of people having questions about their policies was a nice experience, but pretty quickly, he took more and more managing tasks in IT field like reporting, POC for IT shared services in India (US company you said ?) and discovered the dark side of development through VBA Excel in “automatisation of heavily manual processes”.

      After a few years and taking more and more IT oriented tasks, he discovered the IT project management area and learned a little bit by himself before moving to a position of IT project manager in public organization (FPS Justice).

      It seems the fact he gradually came closer to the developing stuff gave him the willingness to do the jump and become one of those nerdy geeky humans living in front of their screen in a dark room, eating unhealthy food and making technical jokes nobody understand.

      Know you understand why this world belongs to us ?

    Recently he talked me about some technical stuffs that might interesting him… As long as he gives me cans of salmon and do not exceed the  45 dB limits my soft and royal ears can accept, I might have accepted to listen to him.
    Have you ever heard about IT security ? Not the one related to some anti-ransomewares or anti-spywares softwares. These products that are sold to individuals as those kind of malicious programs are lately more and more sent to homeworkers.
    What interests him more is the IT security in the entreprises’ world. How to protect your data from outsiders’ attack ? How to encrypt your data ? And what about the possible insider threat ? Is anything predictable or at least, is it hack-proof?

    This area seems so boring, he can be thankful to me to listen to him ! At least, I’m happy his knowledge about it is still really light…
